Out of the box, the app makes a call to an API with a list of hotels + their details
The app displays a full list of hotels on page load

Allow the user to SORT (by price) and FILTER (by hotel name) the results

To Do:

[x] Read/understand how the API data is structured, build small set of dummy data for tests (or use API data)

[x] Break into components

[] Sort function - three possible views
    [] 1. Price - lowest to highest
    [] 2. Price - highest to lowest
    [] 3. Recommended - (probably) Sory by rating
[] Filter function - look for hotels that contain the characters the user types

[] Tests
    [] Sort
    [] Filter
    [] Server error/API returns nothing

[] Extra Styling

What I did:
1. Made test array
2. Broke pieces into componets
3. First instinct: pass hotels called from API as props into the SearchControls
    - if no filter/sort, show list of hotels as called by API
    - if either/both controls used, rearragne list of hotels according to input
    - regardless of filtering/searching,
4. From SearchControls, pass hotels as props again to HotelList
    - this iteration of the list will either be altered or unaltered from API depending on user input
